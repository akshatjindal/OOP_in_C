## Aim: 
How do we implement a CPP style class in C

How can we add more OOP features to said class

### Goal: 
Display inhertiance 
- Let a Rectangle class inherit from it's parent, the Shape class

Display Polymorphism
- In cpp we can use the **virtual** keyword to let child classes override functions
- This was the tricky part, understanding how Vtable work and how they point to the functions via function pointers was cool
